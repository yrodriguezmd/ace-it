# Artificially Conscious Entity Ironic Test 
_The ORO Health Data Science skin-in-the-game test_

Hello candidate!
We are super excited that you have been selected and interested to take on our technical challenge!
This document is intended for an image classification problem with 3 skin disease types.
Description:
In this experiment, you are expected to predict the type of skin disease seen on an image. The classes are “acne”, “herpes simplex”, and “lichen planus”. A classification report will be used to measure the model’s success. Keep in mind that the given dataset is a subset of all data and your model will be tested against a separate set of images with the same disease types.
This is meant for you to demonstrate your talent.
You do ***NOT*** need to create the perfect model. It is for you to decide what is enough in terms of code, documentation, etc. to demonstrate your talent.

## Basic requirements:
In the submitted file you should add,
1- Documentation of experiment including hardware, software, CPU/GPU runtime information as well as a summary of the approach, limitations, and possible improvements that you would do if you had more time and computational power.  
2- Code snippet that we can run and replicate your results, and use to predict the classes of test images.  
3- Classification Report 


## Training Data:
112 images in 3 classes  

Acne: 40 images
Herpes Simplex: 16 images Lichen Planus: 56 images

The images are taken from http://www.danderm-pdv.is.kkh.dk/atlas/index.html with their permission to use for this technical test.
